    "\n",
    "Short for Numerical Python, it is one of the most important foundational packages for numerical computing in Python. You will very likely encounter this package throughout your software experience, including AI methods such as machine learning. NumPy provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "-np.array: a function to convert objects of Python into \"ndarrays\", which are the Python equivalent of a Matlab matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "-array functions and methods that make for easy manipulation of matrices as seen in linear algebra, along with operations one takes for granted on matrices, such as addition, multiplication, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "-NumPy provides functions that can easily operate on matrices, for vectorizing code or applying function on a by-element basis, as Matlab does (instead of applying LOOPS to each element of a matrix). For instance, the Python math module called as **import math** has its own natural logarithm function, math.log(). But this logarithm function does not overload to arrays. NumPy has np.log() which allows you to operate on arrays, where if A is an array, np.log(A) applies the natural log to each element of A. You will see more functions as we proceed. \n",

    "-other linear algebra methods and algorithms\n",
    "\n",

    "# Import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "We write **import numpy as np** to call numpy functions using np.*Numpy_function_name_here*(). You could write **import numpy as WHATEVER** and call, say the log function as WHATEVER.log(), but it has become custom to use \"np\". There are ways to import numpy functions/methods without using any pre-qualifier like 'np.log' and just use 'log', but this is not recommended, since many numpy functions have the same name as other Python functions or those in other modules you might import, creating potential naming conflicts. An example is the logarithm function, which math.log() calls the log from the math module, and np.log() calls the log function from the NumPy module. "
